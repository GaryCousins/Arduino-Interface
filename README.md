# Arduino-Interface

Graphical test interface for an Arduino
See corresponding interface.ino for data format and test file

To use the exe file directly without the LabView IDE you will need the LabView v8.0 runtime environment and the Serial Interface driver version 3.2 (newer versions exist but i've found this the most stable) form the National Instrument website.

Free to use, but I’d be keen to know if it's being used for anything interesting.
While these files are effectively unsuppoerted I’ll do my best to answer questions.
Any comments Welcome.
